Regional Southern Ocean (RSO)
-----------------------------

- to be used on gulf
- default is 10km resolution, 42 vertical z levels
- execute the following steps
- model preparation is done in MATLAB

>>> Do this first (only once)
  ssh to gulf
  Make a clone of this directory:
  $ git clone (insert github URL) /data/$USER/RSO

  After this do the following

  Start MATLAB:
  $ /usr/local/packages/MATLAB/R2012a/bin/matlab -r '\''opengl software'\'' -nodesktop -nosplash
  Execute the following commands in order:

0. topography generation: create_topo.m
  Interpolate & smooth etopo2

1. grid generation: create_vert_grid.m
* Skip this unless you are an expert MITgcm user
* for 42 and 100 vertical levels, it is already completed.

2. surface forcing: create_surfforcing.m
* Currently, monthly NCEP1

3. side boundary condition: create_bcs.m
* SODA 2.2.4 monthly

4. initial condition in T and S: create_init.m
* SODA 2.2.4

5. surface SST and SSS restoring fields: create_sst_sss_restoring.m
* SODA 2.2.4 monthly

  At this point you created binary input files necessary to drive the model

  Execution:

- to be used on atlas-6 system
